public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World!!");
    }
}

//Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
//Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
//The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
//System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output".
//The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
//There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
//The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output.
//You can also use the println() method to print numbers.
//However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes.

System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(358);
System.out.println(50000);

//Input in java 

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(input.nextInt());
        
In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:
String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

Syntax
type variableName = value;

Example
Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John":
String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);

Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:

int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);

int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";     // String

The println() method is often used to display variables.
To combine both text and a variable, use the + character:

Example
String firstName = "John ";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + lastName;
System.out.println(fullName);

Output:John Doe

For numeric values, the + character works as a mathematical operator (notice that we use int (integer) variables here):

Example
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y); // Print the value of x + y

From the example above, you can expect:

x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
Then we use the println() method to display the value of x + y, which is 11

The general rules for naming variables are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
Names must begin with a letter
Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names

Data types are divided into two groups:

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)

Primitive Data Types
A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

Data       Type	Size   	   Description
byte	     1 byte	         Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	     2 bytes	       Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	       4 bytes	       Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long 	     8 bytes         Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	     4 bytes	       Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	   8 bytes	       Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean	   1 bit	         Stores true or false values
char	     2 bytes         Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

Numbers
Primitive number types are divided into two groups:

Integer types stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals.
Valid types are byte, short, int and long. Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value.

Floating point types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and double.

Integer Types
Byte
The byte data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127.
This can be used instead of int or other integer types to save memory when you are certain that the value will be within -128 and 127:

Example
byte myNum = 100;
System.out.println(myNum);

Short
The short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767:

Example
short myNum = 5000;
System.out.println(myNum);

Int
The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
In general, and in our tutorial, the int data type is the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.

Example
int myNum = 100000;
System.out.println(myNum);

Long
The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L":

Example
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);

Floating Point Types
You should use a floating point type whenever you need a number with a decimal, such as 9.99 or 3.14515.

The float and double data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles:

Float Example
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);

Double Example
double myNum = 19.99d;
System.out.println(myNum);

Use float or double?

The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point.
The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits.
Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

Scientific Numbers
A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10:

Example
float f1 = 35e3f;
double d1 = 12E4d;
System.out.println(f1);
System.out.println(d1);

Boolean Types
Very often in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can only take the values true or false:

Example
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isFishTasty = false;
System.out.println(isJavaFun);     // Outputs true
System.out.println(isFishTasty);   // Outputs false

Characters
The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

Example
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);

Alternatively, if you are familiar with ASCII values, you can use those to display certain characters:

Example
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1);
System.out.println(myVar2);
System.out.println(myVar3);

Strings
The String data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

Example
String greeting = "Hello World";
System.out.println(greeting);

Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
